# 🐾 **Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN** 🖼️

This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch. Leveraging the power of **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and other Python libraries, this model analyzes visual patterns in images to accurately distinguish between cats and dogs. Trained on a dataset of **8,000 images**, the model demonstrates the potential of CNNs in solving image classification challenges.

## 📂 **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection**  
- The dataset contains **8,000 labeled images** (4,000 cats and 4,000 dogs).  
- Images are preprocessed to standardize size and format before being fed into the model.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- Resize all images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 64x64 pixels).  
- Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 for faster convergence.  
- Split the data into **training** (80%) and **testing** (20%) sets.

### **3. CNN Model Development**  
- Designed a **Convolutional Neural Network** with the following architecture:  
  - **Input Layer**: Accepts preprocessed image data.  
  - **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features using filters.  
  - **Pooling Layers**: Down-sample feature maps to reduce computational complexity.  
  - **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features for classification.  
  - **Output Layer**: A sigmoid activation function outputs the probability of the image being a cat or dog.

### **4. Model Training**  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer was used for efficient gradient descent.  
- **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy for binary classification.  
- **Batch Size**: 32 images per batch.  
- **Epochs**: The model was trained for 25 epochs on the training data.

### **5. Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using metrics like:  
  - **Accuracy**  
  - **Precision**  
  - **Recall**  
  - **F1-Score**  

### **6. Visualization**  
- **Matplotlib** was used to visualize:  
  - Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.  
  - Sample predictions on test images.
